                <p style="font-family: 'Big Shoulders Stencil Display', cursive;">Cuba is a 1,300 km long island between North and South America in the northwestern Caribbean.
                    Cuba is located 77 km from Haiti, 180 km from Florida, 210 km from Mexico and 140 km from Jamaica.
                    In the north, Cuba is washed by the waters of the Florida Strait, in the south - by the Caribbean Sea.
                    Cuba is located on the island of Cuba, Juventud Island, and other small islands.
                    The coastline is characterized by deep bays and many convenient bays.
                    The island is surrounded by reefs and other coral formations. Cuba's area is 111 thousand kmÂ².

                <p class="par" style="font-family: 'Big Shoulders Stencil Display', cursive;">Cuba is temperate tropical.
                    The division into dry and rainy seasons is rather arbitrary.
                    The tropical dry season lasts from November to April, and the rainy season lasts from May to October.
                    But at the same time, a strong tropical downpour can pass in March, and in June - September dry sunny weather will stand for weeks.
                    The main inconvenience occurs in the fall during the so-called hurricane season, which lasts from October to November.
                    However, hurricanes in Cuba are irregular, and rarely pass two years in a row over the same territory and at the same time.
                    So the likelihood of good weather in the fall is also very high, and the chance of getting caught in a hurricane is rather small.</p>

                    <p class="parThird" style="font-family: 'Big Shoulders Stencil Display', cursive;">In the country, it is strictly forbidden to photograph military equipment, military personnel and industrial enterprises.
                        The local population is distinguished by its friendliness and hospitality. Cubans have a cheerful disposition, they are musical and are very fond of various holidays.
                        They are real patriots, they love their country.
                        Family is of great importance to Cubans.
                        Families here are usually large and very friendly.
                        Cubans always respect the older members of the family with great respect and love children very much.
                        There are no street children in Cuba, because even if their parents are lost, they will not be sent to an orphanage, but will be brought up by the whole clan.</p>

            <p class="par5" style="font-family: 'Big Shoulders Stencil Display', cursive;">
            Tourism in Cuba attracts over 2 million people annually and is one of the main sources of income for the island nation.
            Among the factors influencing the popularity of Cuba as a holiday destination is the high attractiveness of its natural, historical and cultural recreational resources.
            The tourists themselves, in fact, are separated from the inhabitants of Cuba - hotels,
            beaches and entertainment facilities are located in small enclaves, where access to ordinary Cubans is limited.
